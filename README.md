# Twitter-Tweet-analysis-using-NLP

In this problem, we are considering the Donald Trump(U.S president) tweets. He became popular using his tweets.

## Problem Statement:

Considering his twitter and finding how many positive, negative and neutral tweets. Building an ML classifier model using his tweets and polarity (positive,negative and neutral)


For deciding the polarity of tweets & text pre-processing, we are using **NLP technique**. For building the ML model, we are using **Random Forest & KN classifier**


## Tasks performed:

a) Importing of dataset 

b) Found out how many tweets he made on the year 2017

c) Cleaning the data (using NLTK, regular expression, strings etc libraries)

d) Applied Ngrams to processed data and print first 3 rows

e) Applied word tokenisation

f) Applied Stemming using porter stemmer

g) Applied Lemmatization techique

h) calculated the Sentiment scores and polarity for each tweet

i) Found out - POSITIVE, NEGATIVE & NEUTRAL tweets

j) Coverted the processed text data to vectors using TFIDF vectorisor

j) Built ML model based on the processed text vectors & class polarity


## Dataset Description:

The dataset consists of 7375 tweets with 10 columns

## Topics Covered:

a) Tokenization

b) Ngrams

c) Stemming

d) Lemmatization

e) Stop words removal, punctuation removal

d) Building ML model
